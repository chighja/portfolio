          <h3>A little bit about me:</h3>
          <p>
            Hello! My name is Corey and I am a full stack web developer and
            recent graduate of the Full Stack Web Development program at
            Thinkful. I am located in the Baltimore/DC area.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love to experience new ideas and find that life is an ongoing
            journey of learning. If I'm not devling into code headfirst, I'm
            often playing an instrument or singing with a group in a venue or
            divebar near you.
          </p>
